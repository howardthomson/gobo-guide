		"Test for validity rule GVWMC-2"

	remark: "[
		In this test the hexadecimal integer constant '0x1000' in '{INTEGER_8} 0x1000'
		is too big to be representable as an INTEGER_8, even though it appears in a
		constant attribute of type INTEGER_16.

		This rule is missing in ECMA 367-2.
		ISE reports a syntax error.
