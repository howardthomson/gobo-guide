Changes needed to make it possible to mix separately compiled libraries into
a single Eiffel process at run time ...

Arrays indexed by class_id:

	GE_types

Explicit class_id used in:

	GE_boxedXXX routines
	default values (initialized structs)

	polymorphic call routines
	polymorphic attribute access
		Use RCU for update of access data structures
		Maybe use an AVL tree for this ?


Initialization routines for:

	once values, per thread/process
	once status flags, per thread/process
	inline constants

	GE_const_init (strings ...)

Other:

	GE_dts[]	???


Run-time target classifications:
	single/multi threaded
	whole-system vs separate compilation
	dynamic class loading available true/false
